challenge 3

This exercise was one of the harder assignments that I've worked on.  The concepts of Javascript are still something that I'm still working through to understand.  I did enjoy using the methods and functions to complete the assignment.  The last hurdle that I had come across was not being able to display my password.   I learned that I had a duplicate variable that was clearing the results of the array.
